# Advanced Unit Testing

This repository introduces and provides examples of some advanced Unit Testing features. Examples are in Node.js but the techniques are applicable across languages and platforms. We'll use: 

* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) for describing, running and building tests
* [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com) for our assertions

## Development environment setup

You'll obviously need Node.js to run the examples here.

* You'll need to install Mocha globally to use the `mocha` command. To do this type `npm install -g mocha`
* Install other dependencies with `npm install`
